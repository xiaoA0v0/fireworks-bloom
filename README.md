# fireworks-bloom
HTML5 Canvas动画
This is a cool HTML5 Canvas animation. It will simulate the animation effects of fireworks blooming in our real life. The effect is very realistic. One thing about this HTML5 Canvas animation is excellent, that is, its performance. There is basically no feeling of being stuck on Chrome, even if you release a lot of fireworks.
